# Reward Model Training and Evaluation Summary

This notebook demonstrates the training and evaluation of a reward model for ranking text responses based on quality or preference.

## Dataset and Setup
- The notebook uses a dataset from "results.csv" containing prompts, answers, and ranking scores
- GPT-2 is used as the base model, fine-tuned for a regression task to predict ranking scores
- The tokenizer is configured with padding to handle variable-length inputs

## Training Process
- The model is trained for 100 steps with a small batch size of 2
- Training arguments include a learning rate of 5e-5 and logging every 10 steps
- The training loss decreases steadily from ~1.6 to ~0.28, indicating successful learning

## Model Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated on sample joke candidates for the prompt "Write a funny joke about computers"
- A scoring function is implemented that:
  - Takes a prompt and answer text
  - Tokenizes and processes the input
  - Returns a sigmoid-transformed score between 0 and 1

## Results
- The model successfully ranks the joke candidates with scores:
  - "How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it." (0.954)
  - "Why did the computer go to therapy? It had too many unresolved issues." (0.948)
  - "I told my computer a joke, but it crashed." (0.919)
  - "The computer's password was '1234'... classic security." (0.881)
- Results are visualized in a bar chart showing the relative scores of each candidate

## Applications
This reward model implementation demonstrates a fundamental component of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) systems, where such models help rank and improve AI-generated text based on human preferences.
